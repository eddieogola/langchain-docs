description: Learn how to extend your deep agent's capabilities with skills
---

Skills are reusable agent capabilities that provide specialized workflows and domain knowledge.
You can use [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) to provide your deep agent with new capabilities and expertise.
Deep agent skills follow the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/).

## What are skills

Skills are a directory of folders, where each folder has one or more files that contain context the agent can use:

- A `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata about the skill
- Additional scripts (optional)
- Additional reference info, such as docs (optional)
- Additional assets, such as templates and other resources (optional)

<Note>
  Any additional assets (scripts, docs, templates, or other resources) must be referenced in the `SKILL.md` file with information on what the file contains and how to use it so the agent can decide when to use them.
</Note>

## How do skills work

When you create a deep agent, you can pass in a list of directories containing skills.
As the agent starts, it reads through the frontmatter of each `SKILL.md` file.

When the agent receives a prompt, the agent checks if it can use any skills while fulfilling the prompt.
If it finds a matching prompt, it then reviews the rest of the skill files.
This pattern of only reviewing the skill information when needed is called progressive disclosure.

## Examples

You might have a skills folder that contains a skill to use a docs site in a certain way, as well as another skill to search the arXiv preprint repository of research papers:

```plaintext
    skills/
    ├── langgraph-docs
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── arxiv_search
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── arxiv_search.ts # code for searchign arXiv
```

The `SKILL.md` file always follows the same pattern, starting with metadata in the frontmatter and followed by the instructions for the skill.
The following example shows a skill that gives instructions on how to provide relevant langgraph docs when prompted:

```md
---
name: langgraph-docs
description: Use this skill for requests related to LangGraph in order to fetch relevant documentation to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
---

# langgraph-docs

## Overview

This skill explains how to access LangGraph Python documentation to help answer questions and guide implementation.

## Instructions

### 1. Fetch the Documentation Index

Use the fetch_url tool to read the following URL:
https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt

This provides a structured list of all available documentation with descriptions.

### 2. Select Relevant Documentation

Based on the question, identify 2-4 most relevant documentation URLs from the index. Prioritize:

- Specific how-to guides for implementation questions
- Core concept pages for understanding questions
- Tutorials for end-to-end examples
- Reference docs for API details

### 3. Fetch Selected Documentation

Use the fetch_url tool to read the selected documentation URLs.

### 4. Provide Accurate Guidance

After reading the documentation, complete the user's request.
```

## Usage

Pass the skills directory when creating your deep agent:



<Tabs>
<Tab title="StateBackend">

```typescript
import { createDeepAgent, type FileData } from "deepagents";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();

function createFileData(content: string): FileData {
  const now = new Date().toISOString();
  return {
    content: content.split("\n"),
    created_at: now,
    modified_at: now,
  };
}

const skillsFiles: Record<string, FileData> = {};

const skillUrl =
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs/refs/heads/main/examples/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md";
const response = await fetch(skillUrl);
const skillContent = await response.text();

skillsFiles["/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md"] = createFileData(skillContent);

const agent = await createDeepAgent({

  // IMPORTANT: deepagents skill source paths are virtual (POSIX) paths relative to the backend root.
  skills: ["/skills/"],

      },

    files: skillsFiles,
  },
  config,

```

</Tab>
<Tab title="StoreBackend">

```typescript

import {

const response = await fetch(skillUrl);
const skillContent = await response.text();
const fileData = createFileData(skillContent);

await store.put(["filesystem"], "/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md", fileData);

const backendFactory = (config: { state: unknown; store?: BaseStore }) => {
  return new StoreBackend({
    state: config.state,
    store: config.store ?? store,
  });
};

const agent = await createDeepAgent({
  backend: backendFactory,
  store: store,
  checkpointer,
  // IMPORTANT: deepagents skill source paths are virtual (POSIX) paths relative to the backend root.
  skills: ["/skills/"],
});

const config = {
  recursionLimit: 50,
  configurable: {
    thread_id: `thread-${Date.now()}`,
  },
};

const result = await agent.invoke(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "what is langraph? Use the langgraph-docs skill if available.",
      },
    ],
  },
  config,
);
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="FilesystemBackend">

```typescript
import { createDeepAgent, FilesystemBackend } from "deepagents";
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();
const backend = new FilesystemBackend({ rootDir: process.cwd() });

const agent = await createDeepAgent({
  backend,
  skills: ["./examples/skills/"],
  interruptOn: {
    read_file: true,
    write_file: true,
    delete_file: true,
  },
  checkpointer, // Required!
});

const config = {
  configurable: {
    thread_id: `thread-${Date.now()}`,
  },
};

const result = await agent.invoke(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "what is langraph? Use the langgraph-docs skill if available.",
      },
    ],
  },
  config,
);
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<ParamField body="skills" type="list[str]" optional>
    List of skill source paths.
    Paths must be specified using forward slashes and are relative to the backend's root.
    - When using StateBackend (default), provide skill files with `invoke(files={...})`.
    - With FilesystemBackend, skills are loaded from disk relative to the backend's root_dir.

    Later sources override earlier ones for skills with the same name (last one wins).
</ParamField>



## When to use skills and tools

These are a few general guidelines for using tools and skills:

- Use skills when there is a lot of context to reduce the number of tokens in the system prompt.
- Use skills to bundle capabilities together into larger actions and provide additional context beyond single tool descriptions.
- Use tools if the agent does not have access to the file system.
