description: Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks
---

Deep agents are the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs—with builtin capabilities for task planning, file systems for context management, subagent-spawning, and long-term memory.
You can use deep agents for any task, including complex, multi-step tasks.

:::python
[`deepagents`](https://pypi.org/project/deepagents/) is a standalone library built on top of [LangChain](/oss/langchain/)'s core building blocks for agents. It uses the [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/) runtime for durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and other features.

:::js
[`deepagents`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepagents) is a standalone library built on top of [LangChain](/oss/langchain/)'s core building blocks for agents and using [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/)'s tooling for running agents in production.
:::

The `deepagents` library contains:
- **Deep Agents SDK**: A package for building agents that can handle any task
- **Deep Agents CLI**: A coding tool built on top of the `deepagents` package

[LangChain](/oss/langchain/) is the framework that provides the core building blocks for your agents.
To learn more about the differences between LangChain, LangGraph, and Deep Agents, see [Frameworks, runtimes, and harnesses](/oss/concepts/products).

## <Icon icon="wand-magic-sparkles" /> Create a deep agent

:::python
```python
# pip install -qU deepagents
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[get_weather],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```
:::

:::js
```ts
import * as z from "zod";
// npm install deepagents langchain @langchain/core
import { createDeepAgent } from "deepagents";
import { tool } from "langchain";

const getWeather = tool(
  ({ city }) => `It's always sunny in ${city}!`,
  {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get the weather for a given city",
    schema: z.object({
      city: z.string(),
    }),
  },
);

const agent = createDeepAgent({
  tools: [getWeather],
  system: "You are a helpful assistant",
});

console.log(
  await agent.invoke({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the weather in Tokyo?" }],
  })
);
```

See the [Quickstart](/oss/deepagents/quickstart/) and [Customization guide](/oss/deepagents/customization/) to get started building your own agents and applications with deep agents.

## When to use the Deep Agents

Use the **Deep Agents SDK** when you want to build agents that can:
- **Handle complex, multi-step tasks** that require planning and decomposition
- **Manage large amounts of context** through file system tools
- **Delegate work** to specialized subagents for context isolation
- **Persist memory** across conversations and threads

:::python
For building simpler agents, consider using LangChain's [`create_agent`](/oss/langchain/agents) or building a custom [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) workflow.

Use the **Deep Agents CLI** when you want to use an interactive deep agent on the command-line for coding or other tasks:

- **Customize** agents with skills and memory.
- **Teach** agents as you use them about your preferences, common patterns, and custom project knowledge.
- **Execute code** on your machine or in sandboxes.

## Core capabilities

<Card title="Planning and task decomposition" icon="timeline">
    Deep agents include a built-in [`write_todos`](/oss/langchain/middleware/built-in#to-do-list) tool that enables agents to break down complex tasks into discrete steps, track progress, and adapt plans as new information emerges.
</Card>
<Card title="Context management" icon="scissors">
    File system tools ([`ls`](/oss/deepagents/harness#file-system-access), [`read_file`](/oss/deepagents/harness#file-system-access), [`write_file`](/oss/deepagents/harness#file-system-access), [`edit_file`](/oss/deepagents/harness#file-system-access)) allow agents to offload large context to in-memory or filesystem storage, preventing context window overflow and enabling work with variable-length tool results.
</Card>
<Card title="Subagent spawning" icon="people-group">
    A built-in `task` tool enables agents to spawn specialized subagents for context isolation. This keeps the main agent's context clean while still going deep on specific subtasks.
</Card>
<Card title="Long-term memory" icon="database">
    Extend agents with persistent memory across threads using LangGraph's [Memory Store](/oss/langgraph/persistence#memory-store). Agents can save and retrieve information from previous conversations.
